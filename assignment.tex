\section{Git and GitHub}

\subsection{Repository Initialization and Commits}
Write about how you set up the repository for this assignment. Explain every step in detail.
\\
\\\textbf{1. Create a New Repository on GitHub}
\\Log in to your GitHub account at github.com.
Click the green New button (or navigate to the "Repositories" tab and select "New").
\\Fill in the repository details.
\\Public the Repository.
\\Initialize Repository: Check the box to add a README.md file to start the repository.
\\Click Create Repository.
\\
\\\textbf{2. Clone the Repository Locally}
\\Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
\\Copy the repository’s URL by clicking the Code button and selecting HTTPS or SSH.
\\Open a terminal (or Git Bash) on your local machine and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
\\git clone repositoryname
\\
\\\textbf{3. Add Your LaTeX Files}
\\Create your .tex file.
\\
\\\textbf{4. Track Changes with Git}
\\Use git status to check the current state of your repository.
\\Stage the changes with git add .
\\Commit the changes git commit -m "Initial commit: Add LaTeX files for assignment"
\\Push your committed changes to the GitHub repository  git push origin main
\\
\\
\\
\\
\subsection{GitHub Actions for LaTeX Compilation}
Provide a walkthrough of setting up GitHub Actions to automatically compile your LaTeX document and any challenges you encountered.
\\
\\\textbf{1.Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow}
\\GitHub Actions uses YAML files to define workflows. These YAML files are typically placed in the .github/workflows/ directory of your repository.
\\To create the workflow for LaTeX compilation, follow these steps:
\\Navigate to Your Repository: Open the GitHub repository where your LaTeX project is stored.
\\Create a New Directory for Workflows: Inside your repository, create a .github/workflows/ directory if it doesn’t already exist.
\\Create the Workflow File: Create a new YAML file (e.g., latex.yml) in the .github/workflows/ directory.
\\
\\\textbf{2. Write the Workflow YAML}
\\I use the template that was in your github.
\\
\\\textbf{3.Commit the Workflow File}
\\Once the latex.yml file is created, add and commit the file to your repository:  
\\git add .github/workflows/latex.yml
\\git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for LaTeX compilation"
\\git push origin main
\\After pushing the changes to GitHub, navigate to the Actions tab in your GitHub repository.
You should see the workflow listed, and it will trigger whenever you push to the main branch or create a pull request to main.
Check the logs of the workflow to ensure the LaTeX compilation process works correctly.
\\
\\\textbf{4.Accessing the Compiled PDF}
\\Once the workflow completes, you can download the compiled PDF from the Actions tab by selecting the relevant run and downloading the artifact (finalassignment.pdf).

\section{Exploration Task}
\subsection{Vim Advanced Features}
Explore and document 3 advanced features of Vim that were not covered in class.
\\\textbf{1. Macros: Automating Repetitive Tasks}
\\Vim allows you to record a sequence of actions into a macro, which can be replayed whenever needed. This is useful for automating repetitive editing tasks.
\\How to Record a Macro:
Press q followed by a letter to start recording. The letter will be the register where the macro is stored (e.g., qa will store the macro in register a).
Perform the actions you want to automate. Vim will record each keypress as part of the macro.
Press q again to stop recording.
\\How to Play Back a Macro:
To replay the macro, press @ followed by the register (e.g., @a will replay the macro stored in register a).
You can replay the macro multiple times by specifying a count before pressing @. For example, 5@a will play the macro 5 times.
\\Example Use Case:
If you're editing a document and need to add a comment to multiple lines, you can record a macro to perform the process (e.g., moving to the beginning of a line, typing #, and moving to the next line) and then replay it across all lines.
\\
\\\textbf{2. Buffers and Windows: Managing Multiple Files}
\\In Vim, buffers are in-memory representations of files, and windows are the views that display those buffers. You can easily switch between buffers, split windows, and work on multiple files simultaneously.
\\To list open buffers : :ls
\\To switch to a specific buffer, use:  :b buffernumber
\\To split the window horizontally:  :split
\\To split the window vertically:  :vsplit
\\You can navigate between split windows using Ctrl-w followed by a direction key:
\\Ctrl-w h to move to the left window
\\Ctrl-w j to move to the window below
\\Ctrl-w k to move to the window above
\\Ctrl-w l to move to the right window
\\Example Use Case:
You can open a file in one window, split the window, and then open a different file in the second window. This makes it easier to compare or edit multiple files at once without switching back and forth between tabs.
\\\textbf{3. Search and Replace with Regular Expressions}
\\Vim supports powerful search and replace using regular expressions:
\\Search with /pattern and navigate matches with n (next) or N (previous).
Replace with :
\texttt{\%s/old/new/g for global replacement or \%s/old/new/gc to confirm each one}
\\
\\
\subsection{Memory profiling}
\\
\subsubsection{Memory Leak}
In short, explain what memory leaks are and how they might happen in your program.
\\A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory during execution but fails to release it after it is no longer needed. Over time, this can lead to the program consuming excessive memory, potentially slowing down the system or causing it to crash.
\\How They Happen:
\\Unreleased Allocated Memory: Forgetting to free dynamically allocated memory (e.g., in C/C++ using malloc/new without corresponding free/delete).
\\Circular References: Creating reference cycles where objects reference each other, preventing garbage collectors from reclaiming memory.
\\Improper Resource Management: Not closing file handles, sockets, or other resources, leading to system resource exhaustion.
\\
\subsubsection{Memory profilers}
Read about a tool called Valgrind and write about their purpose and how it helps when memory leaks happen.
\\Purpose of Valgrind: Valgrind is a powerful debugging and profiling tool designed to help developers analyze their programs for memory-related issues, such as memory leaks, invalid memory accesses, and improper memory management. It is particularly useful in programs written in C, C++, and other languages that rely on manual memory management.
\\How Valgrind Helps with Memory Leaks:
\\Detecting Memory Leaks:

Valgrind’s tool memcheck identifies memory that was allocated but not freed before program termination.
It provides detailed reports on where memory was allocated, helping developers pinpoint the source of the leak.
\\Tracking Invalid Memory Access:

Valgrind detects attempts to read or write to memory that was not properly allocated or has already been freed, preventing undefined behavior.
\\Identifying Resource Leaks:

It helps locate memory blocks, file handles, or other resources that were not released, improving resource management.
\\Detailed Diagnostics:

Valgrind generates stack traces that show the exact sequence of function calls leading to the issue, aiding in faster debugging.
\\Real-Time Analysis:

Developers can run their programs under Valgrind to get a live view of memory behavior during execution.
\\
\subsection{GNU/Linux Bash Scripting}
\\
\subsubsection{fzf}
Read about a handy CLI tool called fzf and answer the following questions:
\\• What is fuzzy searching? Give a short description.
\\Fuzzy searching is a technique used to find and match text that approximately matches a given input, even if the input is incomplete, contains typos, or is not an exact match. Instead of requiring precise matches, fuzzy searching prioritizes results based on relevance, often using scoring algorithms to rank potential matches.
\\Fuzzy search tools, like fzf, analyze patterns in the input and compare them against a list of potential matches. This is particularly helpful for:

\\Searching large files or directories.

\\Quickly locating commands or files with partial input.

\\Handling human errors like typos or incomplete entries.
\\
\\• Install \texttt{fzf} on your machine and give a description of what the following command does: 
\texttt{ls | fzf}

\\When you run \texttt{ls | fzf}, a list of files and directories from the current directory is displayed in an interactive interface.
\\You can start typing to filter the list based on partial matches, even if your input is not an exact match.
\\Use the arrow keys to navigate the matches, and press Enter to select an item.
\\This command is useful for navigating and selecting files or directories more efficiently, especially in directories with many items.
\subsubsection{Using fzf to find your favorite PDF}
1. We first need to list the directory of all the files with the extension .PDF. Write a
command to list the directory of all the files with the extension .PDF
HINT: use the command fd for this purpose.
\\\texttt{fd --extension pdf}
\\or
\\\texttt{fd -i --extension pdf}
\\This command will recursively search through the current directory and its subdirectories for .pdf files and list them.
\\
\\2. Now we have to select the PDF we want using fzf. Write a command to use fzf to
select a PDF from the data we gathered above.
\\\texttt{fd --extension pdf | fzf}
\\\texttt{fd -i --extension pdf}: This lists all .pdf files in the current directory and subdirectories.
\texttt{| fzf}: This pipes the output of fd (the list of PDF files) to fzf, allowing you to interactively select a file from the list.
\\
\\
\subsubsection{Opening the file using Zathura}
Now that have selected which PDF we want to open, we can use a very minimalistic
program called Zathura to open it. Write a command that uses the commands above to
open the file using Zathura.
\\\texttt{zathura \$(fd --extension pdf \mid fzf)}
\\\texttt{With this command, the PDF you select will be opened directly in Zathura.}

\subsection{FOSS contribution}
Do you see yourself contributing to FOSS projects in the future? If yes, what kind of
projects are you interested in contributing to? If no, why not?
\\Yes, I do see myself contributing to FOSS.I am particularly interested in contributing to projects related to web development, machine learning, or embedded systems. These are areas I find exciting, and I believe that open-source projects can provide valuable experience in coding, debugging, and collaborating with other developers. I am also drawn to the idea of improving or building tools that can help other students, engineers, or communities, which is one of the core benefits of FOSS.
