# Git and LaTeX Project

This repository is a project that integrates the use of Git for version control and LaTeX for document preparation. The goal is to demonstrate how these tools can be used together, including handling tasks such as searching for files, selecting and opening them, and formatting documents with LaTeX.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:
- Learn how to use `Git` for version control and collaborate on code.
- Explore and document the process of working with LaTeX for formatting technical and scientific documents.
- Use commands like `fd` and `fzf` to make file management easier.
- Automate the process of opening files with tools like `Zathura`.

## Features

This repository includes the following features:
- **File search**: Use `fd` to search for `.pdf` files.
- **Interactive file selection**: Use `fzf` to select the PDF file.
- **Open files in Zathura**: Open selected PDFs directly in Zathura using a combination of commands.
- **LaTeX Documentation**: Documentation and commands formatted in LaTeX.

## How to Use
